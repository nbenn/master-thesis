\caption[Heatmap representations of Pearson and Spearman correlation among feature importance scores obtained by random forest analysis.]{Heatmap representations of correlation matrices obtained by comparing importance scores of features as determined by random forest analysis. Red shades indicate Pearson's product-moment correlation while blue shades visualize Spearman's rank correlation coefficients. For each gene and scrambled well, all available 8 replicates of the \textit{Brucella} Dharmacon unpooled dataset were considered.}\label{fig:forest-corr}
