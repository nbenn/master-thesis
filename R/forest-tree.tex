\caption[Hierarchical clustering on averaged random forest importance scores of cellular features.]{Complete linkage hierarchical clustering performed on euclidean distances from cell feature importance scores, obtained through random forest analysis and averaged by well. For each gene and scrambled well, all available 8 replicates of the \textit{Brucella} Dharmacon unpooled dataset were considered.}\label{fig:forest-tree}
