\caption[Scatterplot visualization showing mean actin intensity against object distance from image center alongside a trend line.]{In order to illustrate the relationship between object location and feature values, a thinned out scatterplot (only a randomly sampled 1\% of datapoints are shown) of mean actin intensity against distance from image center is reproduced alongside a trend-line as calculated by gam of the CRAN mgcv package. An approximately linear trend is discernible which can be found in many feature types.}\label{fig:data-location-trend}
