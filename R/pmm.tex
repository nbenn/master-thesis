\caption[Heatmap plot showing significant genes for InfectX kinome screens as determined by pmm.]{A heatmap plot as produced by the Bioconductor package pmm, which displays all genes that were determined to be significant hits (FDR < 4; indicated by black borders) for at least one pathogen. Genes are ordered by average c\textunderscript{pg} values and both extrema are marked with white dots, while the sharedness score is shown as a scatterplot below. All available kinome screens were taken into consideration.}\label{fig:pmm-heatmap}
