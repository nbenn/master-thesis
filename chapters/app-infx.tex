\label{sec:pathogen-protocols}
The following sections describe materials and methods employed in pathogen specific protocols. This information has been published in \citet{Ramo2014} and is only reproduced for the reader's convenience.

\paragraph{\textit{B. henselae}-specific protocol.}
\textit{Bartonella henselae} \acrshort{atcc}[49882\textsuperscript{T}] \textDelta\textit{bep}G containing plasmid pCD353 \citep{Dehio1998} for IPTG-inducible expression of \acrshort{gfp} were grown on \cgls{cba} plates supplemented with 5\% defibrinated sheep blood (Oxoid) and \SI{50}{\micro\gram\per\milli\litre} kanamycin. Bacteria were incubated at \SI{35}{\celsius} in 5\% \ce{CO2} for \SI{72}{\hour} before re-streaking them on fresh \cgls{cba} and further growth for \SI{48}{\hour}. Cells were washed once after \cgls{sirna}-transfection with M199 (Invitrogen)\slash 10\% \cgls{fbs} using a plate washer (ELx50-16, BioTek). Cells were infected with \textit{B. henselae} at an \cgls{moi} of 400 in \SI{50}{\micro\litre} of M199\slash 10\% \cgls{fbs} and \SI{0.5}{\milli\Molar} IPTG (Applichem) and were incubated at \SI{35}{\celsius} in 5\% \ce{CO2} for \SI{30}{\hour}. Fixation at \cgls{rtmp} was performed using a Multidrop 384 (Thermo Scientific) to wash cells with \SI{50}{\micro\litre} of \cgls{pbs}, fixed in \SI{20}{\micro\litre} of 3.7\% \cgls{pfa} for \SI{10}{\minute}, and washed once more with \SI{50}{\micro\litre} of \cgls{pbs}. Staining was performed on a Biomek liquid handling platform. Fixed cells were washed twice with \SI{25}{\micro\litre} of \cgls{pbs} and blocked in \cgls{pbs}\slash 0.2\% \cgls{bsa} for \SI{10}{\minute}. Extracellular bacteria were labeled with a rabbit serum 2037 against B. henselae \citep{Dehio1997} and a secondary antibody goat anti rabbit A647 (Jackson Immuno) in \cgls{pbs}\slash 0.2\% \cgls{bsa}. Antibodies were incubated for \SI{30}{\minute} each and both incubations were followed by two washings with \SI{25}{\micro\litre} of \cgls{pbs}. Cells were then permeabilized with \SI{20}{\micro\litre} of 0.1\% Triton X-100 (Sigma) for \SI{10}{\minute} and afterwards washed twice with \SI{25}{\micro\litre} of \cgls{pbs}, followed by the addition of \SI{20}{\micro\litre} of staining solution (\cgls{pbs} containing \SI{1.5}{\micro\gram\per\milli\litre} DY-547-Phalloidin, Dyomics and \SI{1}{\micro\gram\per\milli\litre} \cgls{dapi}, Roche). After \SI{30}{\minute} of incubation in the staining solution, cells were washed twice with \SI{25}{\micro\litre} \cgls{pbs}, followed by a final addition of \SI{50}{\micro\litre} of \cgls{pbs}.

\paragraph{\textit{B. abortus}-specific protocol.}
\textit{Brucella abortus} 2308 pJC43 (\textit{aphT::\acrshort{gfp}}) \citep{Celli2005} were grown in \cgls{tsb} medium containing \SI{50}{\micro\gram\per\milli\litre} kanamycin for \SI{20}{\hour} at \SI{37}{\celsius} and shaking (\SI{100}{\rpm}) to an OD of 0.8--1.1. \SI{50}{\micro\litre} of \acrshort{dmem}\slash 10\% containing bacteria was added per well to obtain a final \cgls{moi} of 10000 using a cell plate washer (ELx50-16, BioTek). Plates were then centrifuged at \SI{400}{\gravity} for \SI{20}{\minute} at \SI{4}{\celsius} to synchronize bacterial entry. After \SI{4}{\hour} incubation at \SI{37}{\celsius} and 5\% \ce{CO2}, extracellular bacteria were killed by exchanging the infection medium by \SI{50}{\micro\litre} medium supplemented with 10\% \cgls{fbs} and \SI{100}{\micro\gram\per\milli\litre} gentamicin (Sigma). After a total infection time of \SI{44}{\hour} cells were fixed with 3.7\% \cgls{pfa} for \SI{20}{\minute} at \cgls{rtmp} with the cell plate washer. Staining was performed using a Biomek liquid handling platform. Cells were washed twice with \cgls{pbs} and permeabilized with 0.1\% Triton X (Sigma) for \SI{10}{minute}. Then, cells were washed twice with \cgls{pbs}, followed by addition of \SI{20}{\micro\litre} of staining solution which includes \cgls{dapi} (\SI{1}{\micro\gram\per\milli\litre}, Roche) and DY-547-phalloidin (\SI{1.5}{\micro\gram\per\milli\litre}, Dyomics) in 0.5\% \cgls{bsa} in \cgls{pbs}. Cells were incubated with staining solution for \SI{30}{\minute} at \cgls{rtmp}, washed twice with \cgls{pbs}, followed by final addition of \SI{50}{\micro\litre} \cgls{pbs}.

\paragraph{\textit{L. monocytogenes}-specific protocol.}
After washing an overnight culture of \textit{Listeria monocytogenes} EGDe.PrfA*\acrshort{gfp} three times with \cgls{pbs}, bacteria were diluted in \acrshort{dmem} supplemented with 1\% \cgls{fbs}. Cells were infected at a \cgls{moi} of 25 in \SI{30}{\micro\litre} infection medium per well. After centrifugation at \SI{1000}{\rpm} for \SI{5}{\minute} and incubation for \SI{1}{\hour} at \SI{37}{\celsius} in 5\% \ce{CO2} to allow the bacteria to enter, extracellular bacteria were killed by exchanging the infection medium by \SI{30}{\micro\litre} \acrshort{dmem} supplemented with 10\% \cgls{fbs} and \SI{40}{\micro\gram\per\milli\litre} gentamicin (Gibco). Both medium exchange steps were carried out with a plate washer (ELx50-16, BioTek). After additional \SI{4}{\hour} at \SI{37}{\celsius} in a 5\% \ce{CO2} atmosphere, cells were fixed for \SI{15}{\minute} at \cgls{rtmp} by adding \SI{30}{\micro\litre} of 8\% \cgls{pfa} in \cgls{pbs} to each well using a multidrop 384 device (Thermo Electron Corporation). \cgls{pfa} was removed by four washes with \SI{500}{\micro\litre} \cgls{pbs} per well using the Power Washer 384 (Tecan). Fixed cells were stained for nuclei, actin and bacterially secreted \acrshort{inl}[C]. First, cells were incubated for \SI{30}{\minute} with \SI{10}{\micro\litre} per well of primary staining solution (0.2\% saponin, \cgls{pbs}) containing rabbit derived anti-\acrshort{inl}[C] serum (1:250). After four washes with \SI{40}{\micro\litre} \cgls{pbs} per well cells were stained with \SI{10}{\micro\litre} per well of the secondary staining solution (0.2\% saponin, \cgls{pbs}) containing Alexa Fluor-546 coupled anti-rabbit antibody (1:250, Invitrogen), \cgls{dapi} (\SI{0.7}{\micro\gram\per\milli\litre}, Roche), and DY-647-Phalloidin (\SI{2}{\micro\gram\per\milli\litre}, Dyomics). After four washes with \SI{40}{\micro\litre} \cgls{pbs} per well, the cells were kept in \SI{40}{\micro\litre} \cgls{pbs} per well. The staining procedure was carried out with a Tecan freedom evo robot.

\paragraph{\textit{S.} typhimurium-specific protocol.}
All liquid handing stages of infection, fixation, and immunofluorescence staining were performed on a liquid handling robot (BioTek; EL406). For infection the \textit{S.} typhimurium strain S.Tm\textsuperscript{SopE\_pM975} was used. This strain is a single effector strain, only expressing SopE out of the main four \acrshort{spi}[-1] encoded effectors (\acrshort{sip}[A], \acrshort{sop}[B], \acrshort{sop}[E2] and \acrshort{sop}[E]). Additionally this strain harbors a plasmid (pM975) that expresses \acrshort{gfp} under the control of a \acrshort{spi}[-2] (\acrshort{ssa}[G])-dependent promotor. The bacterial solution was prepared by cultivating a \SI{12}{\hour} culture in \SI{0.3}{\Molar} \cgls{lb} medium containing \SI{50}{\micro\gram\per\milli\litre} streptomycin and \SI{50}{\micro\gram\per\milli\litre} ampicillin. Afterwards a \SI{4}{\hour} subculture (1:20 diluted from the \SI{12}{\hour} culture) was cultivated in \SI{0.3}{\Molar} \cgls{lb} medium containing \SI{50}{\micro\gram\per\milli\litre} streptomycin, which reached an OD\textunderscript{\SI{600}{\nano\meter}}$\approx1.0$ after the respective \SI{4}{\hour} of incubation time. To perform the infection, \SI{16}{\micro\litre} of diluted \textit{S.} typhimurium (\cgls{moi} of 80) were added to the HeLa cells. After \SI{20}{\minute} of incubation at \SI{37}{\celsius} and 5\% \ce{CO2}, the \textit{S.} typhimurium-containing media was replaced by \SI{60}{\micro\litre} \acrshort{dmem}\slash 10\% \cgls{fbs} containing \SI{50}{\micro\gram\per\micro\litre} streptomycin and \SI{400}{\micro\gram\per\micro\litre} gentamicin to kill all remaining extracellular bacteria. After additional \SI{3}{\hour} \SI{40}{\minute} incubation at \SI{37}{\celsius} and 5\% \ce{CO2}, cells were fixed by adding \SI{35}{\micro\litre} 4\% \cgls{pfa}, 4\% sucrose in \cgls{pbs} for \SI{20}{\minute} at \cgls{rtmp}. The fixation solution was removed by adding \SI{60}{\micro\litre} \cgls{pbs} containing \SI{400}{\micro\gram\per\milli\litre} gentamicin. Cells were permeabilized for \SI{5}{\minute} with \SI{40}{\micro\litre} 0.1\% Triton X-100 (Sigma-Aldrich). Afterwards \SI{24}{\micro\litre} of staining solution containing \cgls{dapi} (1:1000, Sigma-Aldrich) and DY-547-phalloidin (\SI{1.2}{\micro\gram\per\milli\litre}, Dyomics) was added (prepared in blocking buffer consisting of 4\% \cgls{bsa} and 4\% Sucrose in \cgls{pbs}). After \SI{1}{\hour} of incubation at \cgls{rtmp}, cells were washed three times with \cgls{pbs} followed by the addition of \SI{60}{\micro\litre} \cgls{pbs} containing \SI{400}{\micro\gram\per\milli\litre} gentamicin.

\paragraph{\textit{S. flexneri}-specific protocol.}
\textit{Shigella flexneri} M90T \textDelta\textit{vir}G pCK100 (PuhpT::ds\-Red) were harvested in exponential growth phase and coated with 0.005\% poly-L-lysine (Sigma-Aldrich). Afterwards, bacteria were washed with \cgls{pbs} and resuspended in assay medium (\acrshort{dmem}, \SI{2}{\milli\Molar} L-Glutamine, \SI{10}{\milli\Molar} HEPES). \SI{20}{\micro\litre} of bacterial suspension was added to each well with a final \cgls{moi} of 15. Plates were then centrifuged for \SI{1}{\minute} at \SI{37}{\celsius} and incubated at \SI{37}{\celsius} and 5\% \ce{CO2}. After \SI{30}{\minute} of infection, \SI{75}{\micro\litre} were aspirated from each well and monensin (Sigma) and gentamicin (Gibco) were added to a final concentration of \SI{66.7}{\micro\Molar} and \SI{66.7}{\micro\gram\per\milli\litre}, respectively. After a total infection time of \SI{3.5}{\hour}, cells were fixed in 4\% \cgls{pfa} for \SI{10}{\minute}. Liquid handling was performed using the Multidrop 384 (Thermo Scientific) for dispension steps and a plate washer (ELx50-16, BioTek) for aspiration steps. For immunofluorescent staining, cells were washed with \cgls{pbs} using the Power Washer 384 (Tecan). Subsequently, cells were incubated with a mouse anti-human \cgls{il-8} antibody (1:300, BD Biosciences) in staining solution (0.2\% saponin in \cgls{pbs}) for \SI{2}{\hour} at \cgls{rtmp}. After washing the cells with \cgls{pbs}, Hoechst (\SI{5}{\micro\gram\per\milli\litre}, Invitrogen), DY-495-phalloidin (\SI{1.2}{\micro\gram\per\milli\litre}, Dyomics) and Alexa Fluor 647-coupled goat anti-mouse IgG (1:400, Invitrogen) were added and incubated for \SI{1}{\hour} at \cgls{rtmp}. The staining procedure was performed using the Biomek NXP Laboratory Automation Workstation (Beckman Coulter).

\paragraph{Adenovirus-specific protocol.}
All liquid handling stages of infection, fixation, and immunofluorescence staining were performed on the automated pipetting system Well Mate (Thermo Scientific Matrix) and washer Hydrospeed (Tecan). For infection screens recombinant Ad2\_\textDelta E3B-e\acrshort{gfp} (short Adenovirus) was utilized as described before \citep{Suomalainen2013,Yakimovich2012}. Adenovirus was added to cells at an \cgls{moi} of 0.1 in \SI{10}{\micro\litre} of an infection media\slash \cgls{fbs} (\acrshort{dmem} supplemented with L-glutamine, 10\% \cgls{fbs}, 1\% Pen\slash Strep, Invitrogen). Screening plates were incubated at \SI{37}{\celsius} for \SI{16}{\hour}, and cells were fixed by adding \SI{21}{\micro\litre} of 16\% \cgls{pfa} directly to the cells in culture media for \SI{45}{\minute} at \cgls{rtmp} or long-term storage at \SI{4}{\celsius}. Cells were washed 2 times with \cgls{pbs}\slash \SI{25}{\milli\Molar} \ce{NH4Cl}, permeabilized with \SI{25}{\micro\litre} 0.1\% Triton X-100 (Pharmaciebiothek). After 2 washes with \cgls{pbs} the samples were incubated at \cgls{rtmp} for \SI{1}{\hour} with \SI{25}{\micro\litre} staining solution (\cgls{pbs}) containing \cgls{dapi} (\SI{1}{\micro\gram\per\milli\litre}, Sigma-Aldrich) and DY-647-phalloidin (\SI{1}{\micro\gram\per\milli\litre}, Dyomics), washed 2 times with \cgls{pbs} and stored until imaging in \SI{50}{\micro\litre} \cgls{pbs}\slash \ce{NaN3}.

\paragraph{Rhinovirus-specific protocol.}
All liquid handling stages of infection, fixation, and immunofluorescence staining were performed on the automated pipetting system Well Mate (Thermo Scientific Matrix) and washer Hydrospeed (Tecan). For infection assays with human Rhinovirus serotype 1a (HRV1a) were carried out as described, except that the anti-VP2 antibody Mab 16\slash 7 was used for staining of the infected cells as described earlier \citep{Jurgeit2012,Jurgeit2010,Mosser2002}. Rhinovirus at an \cgls{moi} of 8 was added to cells in \SI{20}{\micro\litre} of an infection media\slash \cgls{bsa} (\acrshort{dmem} supplemented with GlutaMAX, \SI{30}{\milli\Molar} \ce{MgCl2} and 0.2\% \cgls{bsa}, Invitrogen). Screening plates were incubated for \SI{7}{\hour} at \SI{37}{\celsius}, and cells were fixed by adding \SI{33}{\micro\litre} of 16\% \cgls{pfa} directly to the culture medium. Fixation was either for \SI{30}{\minute} at \cgls{rtmp} or long term storage at \SI{4}{\celsius}. Cells were washed twice with \cgls{pbs}\slash \SI{25}{\milli\Molar} \ce{H2O}, permeabilized with \SI{50}{\micro\litre} 0.2\% Triton X-100 (Sigma- Aldrich) followed by 3 \cgls{pbs} washes and blocking with \cgls{pbs} containing 1\% \cgls{bsa} (Fraction V, Sigma-Aldrich). Fixed and permeabilized cells were incubated at \cgls{rtmp} for \SI{1}{\hour} with diluted mabR16-7 antibody (\SI{0.45}{\micro\gram\per\milli\litre}) in \cgls{pbs}\slash 1\% \cgls{bsa}. Cells were washed 3 times with \cgls{pbs} and incubated with \SI{25}{\micro\litre} secondary staining solution (\cgls{pbs}\slash 1\% \cgls{bsa}) containing Alexa Fluor 488 secondary antibody (\SI{1}{\micro\gram\per\milli\litre}, Invitrogen), \cgls{dapi} (\SI{1}{\micro\gram\per\milli\litre}, Sigma-Aldrich), and DY-647-phalloidin (\SI{0.2}{\micro\gram\per\milli\litre}, Dyomics). Cells were washed twice with \cgls{pbs} after \SI{2}{\hour} of incubation in secondary staining solution and stored in \SI{50}{\micro\litre} \cgls{pbs}\slash \ce{NaN3}.

\paragraph{Vacciniavirus-specific protocol.}
All liquid handing stages of infection, fixation, and immunofluorescence staining were performed on a liquid handling robot (BioTek, EL406). For infection assays a recombinant WR VACV, WR E E\acrshort{gfp}\slash L mCherry, was utilized. For infection, media was aspirated from the \cgls{rnai}-transfected cell plates and replaced with \SI{40}{\micro\litre} of virus solution per well (\cgls{moi} of 0.125). Screening plates were incubated for \SI{1}{\hour} at \SI{37}{\celsius} to allow for infection, after which virus-containing media was removed and replaced with \SI{40}{\micro\litre} \acrshort{dmem}\slash 10\% \cgls{fbs}. \SI{8}{\hour} after infection \SI{40}{\micro\litre} of \acrshort{dmem}\slash 10\% \cgls{fbs} containing \SI{20}{\micro\Molar} cytosine arabinoside (AraC) was added to all wells to prevent virus \cgls{dna} replication in secondary infected cells. \SI{24}{\hour} after infection cells were fixed by the addition of \SI{20}{\micro\litre} 18\% \cgls{pfa} for \SI{30}{\minute} followed by two \cgls{pbs} washes of \SI{80}{\micro\litre}. For immunofluorescence staining of E\acrshort{gfp}, cells were incubated for \SI{2}{\hour} in \SI{30}{\micro\litre} primary staining solution (0.5\% Triton X-100, 0.5\% \cgls{bsa}, \cgls{pbs}) per well, containing anti-\acrshort{gfp} antibody (1:1000). Cells were washed twice in \SI{80}{\micro\litre} \cgls{pbs}, followed by the addition of \SI{30}{\micro\litre} secondary staining solution (0.5\% \cgls{bsa}, \cgls{pbs}) containing Alexa Fluor 488 secondary antibody (1:1000), Hoechst (1:10000), and DY-647-phalloidin (1:1200, Dyomics). Cells were washed twice with \SI{80}{\micro\litre} \cgls{pbs} after \SI{1}{\hour} incubation in secondary staining solution followed by the addition of \SI{80}{\micro\litre} \ce{H2O}.

\section{Decision Trees for Infection Scoring}
\label{sec:app-dectree}
The decision trees for adenovirus and \textit{Bartonella} are shown in section~\ref{sec:infection-scoring} while the ones corresponding to the remaining pathogens (\textit{Brucella}, \textit{Listeria}, rhino\-virus, \textit{Salmonella} and vaccinia virus) follow\footnote{\textit{Shigella} infection scoring currently does not rely on \cgls{dtis}, therefore no decision tree is shown. Please refer to section~\ref{sec:infection-scoring} for details on detection of infected cells in \textit{Shigella} screens.}. Please refer to section~\ref{sec:infection-scoring} for more information of infection scoring, including descriptions of infection patterns upon which these decision trees are based. The corresponding tables show the different thresholds that currently are in use. Due to several experimental parameters affecting intensity measurements, such as age of microscope lamp, plate position in imaging queue or quality of staining, plate-wise adjustments are necessary in some instances. Several plates can be subjected to the same values, but over all datasets, some variation exists. Accompanying each of the following decision trees is a table holding the currently used sets of decision boundaries alongside a percentage value indicating the coverage of a given parameter set. For \textit{Brucella} and vaccinia, only the 12 most frequent sets are printed, while the lists for the remaining pathogens are exhaustive.
