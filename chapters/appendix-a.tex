\label{app:singleCellFeatures}

Additional material. For example long mathematical derivations could be
given in the appendix. Or you could include part of your code that is
needed in printed form. You can add several Appendices to your thesis (as
you can include several chapters in the main part of your work).

\input{R/scf-intro/getData}
\input{R/scf-intro/facetBorder}
\input{R/scf-intro/edgepos}

\input{R/scf-intro/benchmark}

Times for my version are mean \knitrScfBenchmarkFacetMean\ (with sd \knitrScfBenchmarkFacetSd) and total runtime for a plate is \knitrScfBenchmarkFacetTotal, while theirs runs with mean \knitrScfBenchmarkEdgeMean\ (sd \knitrScfBenchmarkEdgeSd) and for a plate \knitrScfBenchmarkEdgeTotal.
