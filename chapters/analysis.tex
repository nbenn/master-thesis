The format in which CellProfiler feature data is stored is only of limited suitability for exploratory data analysis. CellProfiler was originally implemented in the proprietary MATLAB language but has recently been ported to Python as version 2.x, in order to move away from the drawbacks of relying on a closed-source, commercial interpreter. Unfortunately, InfectX workflows are all based on CellProfiler 1.x and there are no current plans for updating to version 2.x. Consequently, all available single cell feature data is stored as MATLAB (Level 5) MAT-files.
