\section{To include a picture}
%% picture 'h'ere, 'b'ottom or 't'op; '!' try to impose your will on latex
\begin{figure}[hbt!]
  %% no file extension; .85 stands for 85% of text width
  \epsfCfile{.85}{geys-2kern} 
  %% legend for the list of figures at the beginning of you thesis
  \caption[Geyser data: binned histogram, Silverman's and another kernel]
  %% legend displayed below the graph.
  {Old Faithful Geyser eruption lengths, $n=272$; binned data and two
    (Gaussian) kernel density estimates ($\times 10$) with $h=h^*= .3348$
    and $h= .1$ (dotted).}
  \label{fig:geys1}
\end{figure}

Or also with \texttt{includegraphics}:
%% picture 'h'ere, 'b'ottom or 't'op; '!' try to impose your will on latex
\begin{figure}[hbt!]
  \centering
  %% no file extension; .5\textwidth stands for 50% of text width
  \includegraphics[width=.5\textwidth]{geys-2kern}
  %% legend for the list of figures at the beginning of you thesis
  \caption[Geyser data: binned histogram, Silverman's and another
  kernel]
  %% legend displayed below the graph.
  {Old Faithful Geyser eruption lengths, $n=272$; binned data and two
    (Gaussian) kernel density estimates ($\times 10$) with $h=h^*= .3348$
    and $h= .1$ (dotted).}
  \label{fig:geys2}
\end{figure}

\section{To make a proof}
\begin{proof}
  $1 + 1 = 2$
\end{proof}

Or mention that \citeauthor{Konis2007} (a person) or \citeauthor{Hastie2009} (multiple
persons) have already done quite a bit work.
