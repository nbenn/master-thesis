# introduction
- infectuous diseases in a global context
- tradiational countermeasure: antibiotics/pathogen directed
- infectome as anti-infective target
- merits and problems of both approaches

## bacterial pathogens
- entry mechanisms
    + zipper
    + trigger
    + invasome mediated
- studied organisms
    + Bartonella
    + Brucella
    + Listeria
    + Salmonella
    + Shigella

## viral pathogens
- entry mechanisms
- studied organisms
    + Adenoviruses
    + Rhinoviruses
    + Vaccinia virus

## data generation
- siRNA and RNAi
- microscopy
- computational image analysis

# mathematical background
- pmm
- glm
- regularization
    + lasso
    + ridge elastic net
- unsorted
    + stability
    + complete separation
    + inference: p-values/sample splitting

# single cell data


because we tend to reward others when they do well and punish them when they do badly, and because there is regression to the mean, it is part of the human condition that we are statistically punished for rewarding others and rewarded for punishing them. - kahneman
