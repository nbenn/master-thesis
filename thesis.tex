%% We use the memoir class because it offers a many easy to use features.

%% LaTeX Font encoding -- DO NOT CHANGE
\usepackage[T1]{fontenc}

%% Babel provides support for languages.  'english' uses British
%% English hyphenation and text snippets like "Figure" and
%% "Theorem". Use the option 'ngerman' if your document is in German.
%% Use 'american' for American English.  Note that if you change this,
%% the next LaTeX run may show spurious errors.  Simply run it again.
%% If they persist, remove the .aux file and try again.
\usepackage[english]{babel}

%% Input encoding 'utf8'. In some cases you might need 'utf8x' for
%% extra symbols. Not all editors, especially on Windows, are UTF-8
%% capable, so you may want to use 'latin1' instead.
\usepackage[utf8]{inputenc}

%% to allow cloring in code listings
\usepackage[dvipsnames]{xcolor}


%% This changes default fonts for both text and math mode to use Herman Zapfs
%% excellent Palatino font.  Do not change this.
\usepackage[sc]{mathpazo}

%% The AMS-LaTeX extensions for mathematical typesetting.  Do not
%% remove.
\usepackage{amsmath,amssymb,amsfonts,mathrsfs}

%% NTheorem is a reimplementation of the AMS Theorem package. This
%% will allow us to typeset theorems like examples, proofs and
%% similar.  Do not remove.
%% NOTE: Must be loaded AFTER amsmath, or the \qed placement will
%% break
\usepackage[amsmath,thmmarks]{ntheorem}
%% alog align groups to be split over pages
\allowdisplaybreaks

%% LaTeX' own graphics handling
\usepackage{graphicx}

%% This allows you to add .pdf files. It is used to add the
%% declaration of originality.
\usepackage{pdfpages}

%% Some more packages that you may want to use.  Have a look at the
%% file, and consult the package docs for each.
\input{setup/extrapackages}

%% Our layout configuration.  DO NOT CHANGE.
\input{setup/layoutsetup}

%% Theorem environments.  You will have to adapt this for a German
%% thesis.
\input{setup/theoremsetup}

%% Helpful macros.
\input{setup/macrosetup}

%% Make document internal hyperlinks wherever possible. (TOC, references)
%% This MUST be loaded after varioref, which is loaded in 'extrapackages'
%% above.  We just load it last to be safe.

[B]ecause we tend to reward others when they do well and punish them when they do badly, and because there is regression to the mean, it is part of the human condition that we are statistically punished for rewarding others and rewarded for punishing them --- \cite{Kahneman2012}.
