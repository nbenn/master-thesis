%% We use the memoir class because it offers a many easy to use features.
\documentclass[11pt,a4paper,titlepage]{memoir}

%% LaTeX Font encoding -- DO NOT CHANGE
\usepackage[OT1]{fontenc}

%% Babel provides support for languages.  'english' uses British
%% English hyphenation and text snippets like "Figure" and
%% "Theorem". Use the option 'ngerman' if your document is in German.
%% Use 'american' for American English.  Note that if you change this,
%% the next LaTeX run may show spurious errors.  Simply run it again.
%% If they persist, remove the .aux file and try again.
\usepackage[english]{babel}

%% Input encoding 'utf8'. In some cases you might need 'utf8x' for
%% extra symbols. Not all editors, especially on Windows, are UTF-8
%% capable, so you may want to use 'latin1' instead.
\usepackage[utf8]{inputenc}

%% This changes default fonts for both text and math mode to use Herman Zapfs
%% excellent Palatino font.  Do not change this.
\usepackage[sc]{mathpazo}

%% The AMS-LaTeX extensions for mathematical typesetting.  Do not
%% remove.
\usepackage{amsmath,amssymb,amsfonts,mathrsfs}

%% NTheorem is a reimplementation of the AMS Theorem package. This
%% will allow us to typeset theorems like examples, proofs and
%% similar.  Do not remove.
%% NOTE: Must be loaded AFTER amsmath, or the \qed placement will
%% break
\usepackage[amsmath,thmmarks]{ntheorem}

%% LaTeX' own graphics handling
\usepackage{graphicx}

%% This allows you to add .pdf files. It is used to add the
%% declaration of originality.
\usepackage{pdfpages}

%% Some more packages that you may want to use.  Have a look at the
%% file, and consult the package docs for each.
\input{setup/extrapackages}

%% Our layout configuration.  DO NOT CHANGE.
\input{setup/layoutsetup}

%% Theorem environments.  You will have to adapt this for a German
%% thesis.
\input{setup/theoremsetup}

%% Helpful macros.
\input{setup/macrosetup}

%% Make document internal hyperlinks wherever possible. (TOC, references)
%% This MUST be loaded after varioref, which is loaded in 'extrapackages'
%% above.  We just load it last to be safe.
\usepackage[
  linkcolor=black,
  colorlinks=true,
  citecolor=black,
  filecolor=black
